   the game there).

   Levels" list.

   inresponsive on some systems.

   errors.

X-Moto 0.1.10 (alpha) 2005-12-03
--------------------------------

 * Nasty (and very stupid) bug that prevented new replays from being
   shown, has been fixed.
 * Spamming your console is no longer default behaviour. If you want
   to enable it, use the new -v command-line option.
 * Log messages are now written to xmoto.log (also on Windows, so 
   there's no longer a stdout.txt).

   shortcuts to best times and replays for a specific level.

   strawberries are no longer gone when rewinding).
 * Applied MacOS X patch by Maxime Biais.
 * Replays can no longer be recorded for levels that include 
   scripting.

   version can read old replays without any problems (in which case
   the new event features will be missing).
 * Faster building procedure on Windows.
 * New built-in levels, one of them by Clive Crous.
 * New tutorial levels. These are now considered external levels, so
   you'll find them under that tab.
 * Smoother playback of replays.
 * Note that I have given up ordering the built-in levels by 
   difficulty. The current order will be kept until beta.
 * Thanks to Petter Reinholdtsen for pointing out that
   SDL/SDL_opengl.h fixes all of the OpenGL problems. :)

X-Moto 0.1.8 (alpha)  2005-11-06
--------------------------------

 * 6 new (difficult) built-in levels by CoW.
 * Very limited sounds (only menu buttons, when picking up 
   strawberries, and a very minimalistic bike engine sound).
 * Uses SDL_mixer for sound playback.
 * No longer directly dependant on the Ogg Vorbis 
   libraries.

   much, as X-Moto have used zlib indirectly through libpng all the 
   time.
 * Replays supported.

 * Non-windows release now dynamically linked with ODE and

 * Paul Nettle's MMGR no longer included in the non-windows release. 
   Apparantly its (custom) license conflicted with the Debian Free 
   Software Guideline #6 (No Discrimination Against Fields of 
   Endeavor) by stating:
   
    - "You may not use this software to directly or indirectly cause
       harm to others."
      
   So this is good news if you want to burn X-Moto unto a CD and kill
   someone with it! :)
 * Main menu no longer eats all of the CPU cycles.
