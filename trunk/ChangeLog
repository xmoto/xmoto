 * Spamming your console is no longer default behaviour. If you want
   to enable it, use the new -v command-line option.

 * New tutorial levels. These are now considered external levels, so
   you'll find them under that tab.

   strawberries, and a very minimalistic bike engine sound).
 * Uses SDL_mixer for sound playback.
 * No longer directly dependant on the Ogg Vorbis
   libraries.

   time.

   Software Guideline #6 (No Discrimination Against Fields of
   Endeavor) by stating:

    - "You may not use this software to directly or indirectly cause
       harm to others."

   So this is good news if you want to burn X-Moto unto a CD and kill
   someone with it! :)
 * Main menu no longer eats all of the CPU cycles.
