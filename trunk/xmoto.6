.SH DESCRIPTION
.B X-Moto
is a challenging 2D motocross platform game, where physics plays an important role in the gameplay. You need to control your bike to its limit, if you want to have a chance finishing the more difficult of the challenges.

.SH GAMEPLAY
A number of strawberries are typically spread around each level, which generally consists of a complicated landscape seen from the side - i.e. much like islands in the sky. You need to collect all those berries to finish the level - when you've got the last one, you need find the sunflower which will complete the level when you touch it. Variations to this basic gameplay may be found around some of the levels.

Your motocross bike is likewise seen from the side, and you control its throttle, braking, and simple changes to the attitude by jerking the bike back and forth. Additionally you can change the direction of your driving, by rotating on the spot.

You control your bike using the keyboard. The following keys are the default values, but may be changed from inside the game:
.TP
.B Up\ arrow
Accelerate.
.TP
.B Down\ arrow
Brake.
.TP
.B Left\ arrow

.TP
.B \-h, \-?, \-help, --help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-res, --resolution <widthxheight>
Forces a specific display resolution.
.TP
.B \--bpp  <bits>
Forces a specific number of bits per pixel.
.TP
.B \-fs, --fullscreen
Forces the game to run in fullscreen mode.
.TP

.TP
.BI \-l, --level\  id

.I id
is a number the corresponding built-in level is selected, otherwise it should be the identifier of an external level (not the file name).
.TP
.B --levelFile <FILE>
Start playing the given level right away.
.TP
.B \-d, --debug
Enables debug mode.
.TP

Enables framerate display.
.TP
.B \-td, --timedemo

This option is very useful if your system doesn't have a proper OpenGL-capable video card (like for instance if you have a laptop with on-board video card).
