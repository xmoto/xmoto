   uneven for development (CVS) versions.

   fonts in editor-bug on AMD64 has also been fixed.
 * Automatic list of screen resolutions (patch by Emmanuel Gorse).

X-Moto 0.1.14 (alpha) 2006-05-19
--------------------------------

 * New version numbering policy: If the last number is even it's
   a stable X-Moto release, otherwise it's an unstable development
   version (from CVS).
 * Major bug in the player head/entity collision detection code fixed. 
 * Level files are now cached for much faster loading time.
 * Integration with Nicolas Adenis-Lamarre's website; World records 
   can now be seen inside the game, and new levels can be downloaded
   automatically.
 * New (optional) library dependency: libcurl. If library isn't found
   by ./configure, the online high-score system is disabled, so please
   install libcurl (version 3) before upgrading to X-Moto 0.1.14. 
   (This does not affect X-Moto on Windows, libcurl is included with 
   the game there).
 * Slight physics adjustment: It should no longer be possible to fall
   through the ground when standing still. Stay calm, this should NOT 
   affect the gameplay.
 * Alpha-testing enabled for sprites; which are less fuzzy looking 
   now. Also looks better with anti-aliasing.
 * Lots of new UI stuff, including context help.

   viewer.

   Thomas Kjaerulff.

   speed and space to pause.

 * Automatic replay naming. 
 * Various minor changes and several other small bugs fixed.

X-Moto 0.1.12 (alpha) 2006-04-09
--------------------------------

 * Fixed a bug that prevented the game from compiling with g++ 4.1.
 * Removed unfinished joystick configuration interface from the menu.
 * New LUA (script) functions. See src/MotoGameL.cpp for details.
 * Files in xmoto.bin are now prioritized lower when loading.

   objective.
 * Added a "Next Level" button to the in-game menus. 
 * You can now have several levels of sub-directories in your Levels/
   directory.
 * Introduced the concept of "level packs", i.e. logical groupings of
   levels. The tutorials are now considered a level pack. Note that
   levels which are in a level pack can't be seen in the "External
   Levels" list.
 * Various minor changes and some small bugs fixed.

X-Moto 0.1.11 (alpha) 2006-02-05
--------------------------------

 * Major optimization of collision detection. The framerate should be
   many-doubled when playing geometry-heavy levels.
 * Game no longer quits if a level specified by the user or a replay
   isn't found.
 * Made a change that hopefully should make mouse movement less 
   inresponsive on some systems.
 * Integrated a patch by Eric Piel that makes the game play more 
   smooth, most notable on lower end systems.
 * Added a (hopefully) better set of build configuration scripts, also
   by Eric Piel. Please notify me if some compatibility is broken by
   this, and I'll try to fix it as fast as possible.
 * New -benchmark option to play with.
 * The user is now warned if he's entering a level with geometrical
   errors.
 * The -replay option now accepts replays regardless of their
   location.   
 * It should now longer be possible to move head through level 
   geometry at high speed or by flipping.
 * A couple of new built-in levels.
 * Level limits are now not invisible when using -ugly.
 * Various minor changes and several small bugs fixed.

X-Moto 0.1.10 (alpha) 2005-12-03
--------------------------------

 * Nasty (and very stupid) bug that prevented new replays from being
   shown, has been fixed.
 * Spamming your console is no longer default behaviour. If you want
   to enable it, use the new -v command-line option.
 * Log messages are now written to xmoto.log (also on Windows, so 
   there's no longer a stdout.txt).
 * Fixed an bug that prevented the game from compiling on Mac OS X
   (thanks again Maxime Biais).
 * The game now defaults to listing all replays, not only the ones
   made by the current player.

X-Moto 0.1.9 (alpha)  2005-12-01
--------------------------------

 * Added a level information viewing user interface, including in-menu
   shortcuts to best times and replays for a specific level.
 * Fixed a bug that caused the game to misbehave if escape was pressed
   while entering the name of a replay to save.
 * Better handling of events in replays (for instance, picked-up 
   strawberries are no longer gone when rewinding).
 * Applied MacOS X patch by Maxime Biais.
 * Replays can no longer be recorded for levels that include 
   scripting.
 * Older releases will not be able to read the new replays, but this
   version can read old replays without any problems (in which case
   the new event features will be missing).
 * Faster building procedure on Windows.
 * New built-in levels, one of them by Clive Crous.
 * New tutorial levels. These are now considered external levels, so
   you'll find them under that tab.
 * Smoother playback of replays.
 * Note that I have given up ordering the built-in levels by 
   difficulty. The current order will be kept until beta.
 * Thanks to Petter Reinholdtsen for pointing out that
   SDL/SDL_opengl.h fixes all of the OpenGL problems. :)

X-Moto 0.1.8 (alpha)  2005-11-06
--------------------------------

 * 6 new (difficult) built-in levels by CoW.
 * Very limited sounds (only menu buttons, when picking up 
   strawberries, and a very minimalistic bike engine sound).
 * Uses SDL_mixer for sound playback.
 * No longer directly dependant on the Ogg Vorbis 
   libraries.
 * Now direclty dependant on zlib, although that propably won't mean
   much, as X-Moto have used zlib indirectly through libpng all the 
   time.
 * Replays supported.
 * Non-windows release with a more intelligent configure script.
 * New -ugly option for computers without a proper OpenGL video card.
 * Custom mouse cursor, the standard SDL one caused some problems for
   some people.

X-Moto 0.1.7 (alpha)  2005-10-27
--------------------------------

 * Game is no longer slow if Vertical Sync limits the 
   framerate.
 * 5 new (easier) built-in levels by Pasi Kallinen.

 * Experimental (!) joystick support.
 * Double-clicking in lists to activate items.
 * Non-windows release now dynamically linked with ODE and
   LUA libraries.
 * Paul Nettle's MMGR no longer included in the non-windows release. 
   Apparantly its (custom) license conflicted with the Debian Free 
   Software Guideline #6 (No Discrimination Against Fields of 
   Endeavor) by stating:
   
    - "You may not use this software to directly or indirectly cause
       harm to others."
      
   So this is good news if you want to burn X-Moto unto a CD and kill
   someone with it! :)
 * Main menu no longer eats all of the CPU cycles.
