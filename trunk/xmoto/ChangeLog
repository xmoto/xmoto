X-Moto 0.1.7 (alpha)  2005-10-25
--------------------------------

 * Finally some sounds effects (not all yet, and only the 
   menus).
 * 5 new (easier) built-in levels by Pasi Kallinen.
 * Configurable controls.
 * Experimental (!) joystick support.
 * Double-clicking in lists to activate items.
 * Non-windows release now dynamically linked with ODE and
   LUA libraries.
 * Paul Nettle's MMGR no longer included in the non-windows
   release. Apparantly its (custom) license conflicted with
   the Debian Free Software Guideline #6 (No Discrimination 
   Against Fields of Endeavor) by stating:
   
    - "You may not use this software to directly or indirectly 
      cause harm to others."
      
   So this is good news if you want to burn X-Moto unto a CD
   and kill someone with it! :)
 * Main menu no longer eats all of the CPU cycles.
