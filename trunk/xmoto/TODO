-> i corrected a bug on stats : hope it doesn't depend on the os : the
   month was 06 for me instead of 07

# for 0.2.0

Assigned to Neckelmann:


* BUG : move a background block make it collide with the bike
 neckelmann:  as it is now a block can not be both dynamic and background.
              it's a limitation. Maybe it can be improved later.

* do you agree if i make a lua function to get the number of
   somersaults ? some "freestyle" could ask for figure to be done.
   in the future, i would like make this functionnality better : time
   in the air, time on one wheel, ...
  neckelmann: sounds good
 
* is it possible to include the speed of the dynamic blocks with lua ?
   the aim is that normally, the moto must move on a block moving
   horizontally
 --comment: well, generally the script is totally responsible for moving
            the blocks, so the script can calculate the velocity itself.            
 -> it is not it : i mean : when you move a block, and when you bike
   is under it, logically, bike should move too : it's
   physics. Currently, it doesn't work because a move is not really a
   move, it's a teleportation, so there is no velocity.
 neckelmann:  ahh, now i get it. Well, I can't come up with an easy way to
              do it. One way to do it is to keep track of everywhere the
              bike touches a dynamic block, and then calculate a suitable
              force on the wheel manually. But I think it's going to be
              crappy. By the way, CVS file chatting is weird :)

* the jump of the moto with dynamic blocks is too much (is this jump
   really necessary ?)
 --comment: i'd rather not touch that any more, i think it's quite stable
            as it is. And yes, the jump is necesary, that's how the 
            physics engine works (to seperate intersection objects/bodies
            it tries to "push" them appart)

* "view the highscore" button is not visible for pack(priority=high)
* add <xml_room> in configuration so that the player can choose the
   link to his room xml file (priority=high)(priority=high)
* themes : not more animation in .xml ? -> be able to load an animated bike ?
* now that there is a lot of replays (dwd due to ghosts), what about
  put "list all" by default in the replays list ?
   neckelmann: it is on per default now, right?   
* BUG : xmoto-edit rgeznlre -> segfault
* BUG : when you see level info in level pack ; then you click on ok
   -> it close the window and the levelpack window
   
# for after
* make something when a perious jump is done : it is quite easy i
   think to detect them
* to be able to move a zone ?
* make sound in themes
* make circle for sprites, strawberries, ... in ugly mode
* BUG : http://xmoto.free.fr/tmp/bugonlinuxppcreplays.jpg : it
   happends on replays on linux ppc
*OpenGL-independent Renderer
   I would like to port XMoto to my GP2X, a Linux-based
 handheld game console. The main problem is that due to
 the lack of an FPU, no OpenGL-implementations with
 acceptable performance are available. The
 floating-point emulation works quite good, so im sure
 that Physics still could be done with ODE.
 But the graphics part would have to be done with the
 2D-capabilities of SDL. I could write a new Renderer
 myself, but i would have to fork the code at its
 current state because OpenGL is tied too deep with the
 code.
 The renderer should be abstracted, so a SDL-Renderer
 can be easily integrated. I think a 2D-based renderer
 would also enable older platforms to play XMoto.
* svg2xmotolvl
* otherwise we could make a "standard xmoto library" of lua functions :)
function testCollision(laserX, laserY, alienX, alienY)
    -- to be remplaced by a real circle collision
    -- made by xmoto using entity r
    alienHalfWidth  = 0.5
    alienHalfHeight = 0.5
    laserHalfWidth  = 0.4
    laserHalfHeight = 0.4

    return laserX + laserHalfWidth &gt; alienX - alienHalfWidth
          and laserX - laserHalfWidth  &lt; alienX + alienHalfWidth
          and laserY + laserHalfHeight &gt; alienY - alienHalfHeight
          and laserY - laserHalfHeight &lt; alienY + alienHalfHeight
end
* loading level is sometimes quite long
* themes : check the md5sum of the files ; don't display available if
   it's not really available
* new script call :
  killPlayer() -> kill the player
  timePenallity(nbSeconds) -> increase time
  collision between sprites, between sprites and head
  move a zone
* collision : collision with the body : triangle with points : head,
   wheels : because it's currently possible to touch a wecker with the
   body and possible to touch a strawberry but that it doesn't take
   it. However, this collision must be avaible only for entities not
   for blocks.
* BUG : is it normal ?
        C.x=(getParent()->getDispWidth() * pArrow->ArrowPointerPos.x) / 800.0f;
        C.y=(getParent()->getDispHeight() * pArrow->ArrowPointerPos.y)
   / 600.0f;
        moreover, it doesn't work with the zoom
and Game.PlaceScreenArrow(5, 5, 225) : doesn't respect coords
* add 3 2 1 GO ! at level startup (only if the level played is
   different from the last played)
* have a <----> for the lists
* it seems that there is a bug on speed it is played (if i play
   replays done on fast machine, it appear faster) http://xmoto.free.fr/replays/replay_1312.rpl
* BUG :
- start a level, press very fastly (ESC-ENTER)* ; quite easy to
   reproduce (works on windows and linux)
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/nicolas/progs/archives/xmoto_cvs/xmoto/xmoto
Program exited normally.
Game.cpp around 1210 : adding a catch ; however, when the exception is
   catched, the level is displayed badly
   	  try {
   	    m_Renderer.render();
	  } catch(Exception &e) {printf("Exception handled\n");}
UPDATE:  It appears it's only possible to produce the bug when ghost is enabled.

* if a script ask for an already used key, propose an other one
* replay arch indepedance structure
* see about timeout when connection failed
* display a nice counter for engine speed : disable this counter in replays
* a button "clean replays" which remove not highscore replays or
   something like it
* check for a new version at startup
* add a counter of uncompleted levels (priority=medium)
* add a tab : favorite levels (priority=low)
* add 2 rooms configurations so that i can display, world highscore
   and highscore of my room (priority=low)
* add import of players.bin (so that people playing at different
   location can merge their highscores) (priority=very low)
* translations (priority=very low)

Undecided:
* allow keep button pressed on list for people having not wheel ;-)
* context information for levels : when one is selected, display
   information
* separate personnal highscores from others (two tabs instead of a
   button, it's easiest) (it neckelmann agree)
* upload highscore from the game ? (require login/password room
   configuration ;-(
* pb for left hand written people for the editor
* two possibilities to show room : one to see the world highscore, one
   to see you room (optionnal)
* allow to run : xmoto -level l1.lvl to allow playing a level just by cliking on
   it (even if it's not in the xmoto dir)
* display wind
