# for 0.1.16

# for after
* try to compile without WEBSUPPORT and GHOST to see the result
* "view the highscore" button is not visible for pack
* add <xml_room> in configuration so that the player can choose the
   link to his room xml file (priority=high)
* BUG : when you see level info in level pack ; then you click on ok
   -> it close the window and the levelpack window

* BUG :
- start a level, press very fastly (ESC-ENTER)* ; quite easy to
   reproduce (works on windows and linux)

Game.cpp around 1210 : adding a catch ; however, when the exception is
   catched, the level is displayed badly
   	  try {
   	    m_Renderer.render();
	  } catch(Exception &e) {printf("Exception handled\n");}


#
* replay arch indepedance structure
* having the information of time diff about the ghost each time you take a strawberry, because we know the information already at this time
* BUG : move objects in script doesn't work
* have a <----> for the lists
* see about timeout when connection failed
* display a nice counter for engine speed : disable this counter in replays
* a button "clean replays" which remove not highscore replays or
   something like it
* check for a new version at startup


* add a counter of uncompleted levels (priority=medium)
* theme (for sprites) (priority=medium)
* add a tab : favorite levels (priority=low)
* add 2 rooms configurations so that i can display, world highscore
   and highscore of my room (priority=low)
* add import of players.bin (so that people playing at different
   location can merge their highscores) (priority=very low)
* translations (priority=very low)

Undecided:
* allow keep button pressed on list for people having not wheel ;-)
* add 3 2 1 GO ! at level startup (it neckelmann agree) 
* context information for levels : when one is selected, display
   information
* separate personnal highscores from others (two tabs instead of a
   button, it's easiest) (it neckelmann agree)
* upload highscore from the game ? (require login/password room
   configuration ;-(
* it seems that there is a bug on speed it is played (if i play
   replays done on fast machine, it appear faster)
* pb for left hand written people for the editor
* two possibilities to show room : one to see the world highscore, one
   to see you room (optionnal)
* allow to run : xmoto -level l1.lvl to allow playing a level just by cliking on
   it (even if it's not in the xmoto dir)
* display wind
* high level function for script : DynamicMove(item, srcX, srcY, dstX, dstY,
   speed, type = "linear") for example : one call manage the movement of the element
