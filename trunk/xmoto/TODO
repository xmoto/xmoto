before next version :
* add <xml_room> in configuration so that the player can choose the
   link to his room xml file
* add a button <see replay> which download the highscore from the
   website and play it
* add a <new level> tab
* when you have a world highscore, display a message (not a popup)
* add a message when internet connexion failed (on highscore, and
   levels download)
* MD5sum to update levels
* what about check for new levels at startup and propose to download
   new levels ?
* IS IT NORMAL THAT AFTER PROXY CONFIGURATION IT DOWNLOAD HIGHSCORES
   ???
* hum : once you choose yes/no first time on connection box, it would
   be nice to save optoins ;-)

for next versions :

* ghost mode
* add 3 2 1 GO ! at level startup (it neckelmann agree) 
* sort level by name (or difficulty (add a difficuly=[0-9]* in lvl ?))
* theme (for sprites)
* context information for levels : when one is selected, display
   information
* separate personnal highscores from others (two tabs instead of a
   button, it's easiest) (it neckelmann agree)
* add a counter of uncompleted levels
* add a button to refresh highscores
* upload highscore from the game ? (require login/password room
   configuration ;-(
* see :
   http://aspegic500.free.fr/xmoto_highscores/replays/replay_707.rpl :
   it seems that there is a bug on replays
* it seems that there is a bug on speed it is played (if i play
   replays done on fast machine, it appear faster)
