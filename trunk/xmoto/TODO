before next version :
* IS IT NORMAL THAT AFTER PROXY CONFIGURATION IT DOWNLOAD HIGHSCORES
   ???
  -- Yes. :) But it could be discussed whether it is necesary if it has
     already been done (the idea is that when the user enables web-access,
     he want to download highscores immediately.
 -> update highscore button
* add <xml_room> in configuration so that the player can choose the
   link to his room xml file

* display f12 in help, and key for replay slow, fast, pause, and the
   current speed to display

for next versions :

* add a button <see replay> which download the highscore from the
   website and play it
* what about check for new levels at startup and propose to download
   new levels ?

* ghost mode
* add 3 2 1 GO ! at level startup (it neckelmann agree) 
* theme (for sprites)
* context information for levels : when one is selected, display
   information
* separate personnal highscores from others (two tabs instead of a
   button, it's easiest) (it neckelmann agree)
* add a counter of uncompleted levels
* add a button to refresh highscores
* upload highscore from the game ? (require login/password room
   configuration ;-(
* see :
   http://aspegic500.free.fr/xmoto_highscores/replays/replay_707.rpl :
   it seems that there is a bug on replays
* it seems that there is a bug on speed it is played (if i play
   replays done on fast machine, it appear faster)
* pb for left hand written people for the editor
* add import of players.bin (so that people playing at different
   location can merge their highscores)
* two possibilities to show room : one to see the world highscore, one
   to see you room (optionnal)
* add 2 rooms configurations so that i can display, world highscore
   and highscore of my room
