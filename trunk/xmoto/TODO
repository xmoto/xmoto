# for 0.1.16
* try to compile without WEBSUPPORT and GHOST to see the result
* add <xml_room> in configuration so that the player can choose the link to his room xml file (priority=high)
* "view the highscore" button is not visible for pack
* update highscores/levels doesn't really update levels, an other idea
   for the button caption ?
* display error : missing texture instead of just "the level has a pb" ?
* BUG : on mac os x : http://xmoto.free.fr/tmp/Letters.png
* BUG : when you see level info in level pack ; then you click on ok
   -> it close the window and the levelpack window

# for after
* having the information of time diff about the ghost each time you take a strawberry, because we know the information already at this time
* BUG : move objects in script doesn't work
* have a <----> for the lists
* see about timeout when connection failed
* display a nice counter for engine speed : disable this counter in replays
* a button "clean replays" which remove not highscore replays or
   something like it
* be able to choose "download highscore" "check for new level" at
   startup
* check for a new version at startup


* add a counter of uncompleted levels (priority=medium)
* theme (for sprites) (priority=medium)
* add a tab : favorite levels (priority=low)
* add 2 rooms configurations so that i can display, world highscore
   and highscore of my room (priority=low)
* add import of players.bin (so that people playing at different
   location can merge their highscores) (priority=very low)
* translations (priority=very low)

Undecided:
* allow keep button pressed on list for people having not wheel ;-)
* add 3 2 1 GO ! at level startup (it neckelmann agree) 
* context information for levels : when one is selected, display
   information
* separate personnal highscores from others (two tabs instead of a
   button, it's easiest) (it neckelmann agree)
* upload highscore from the game ? (require login/password room
   configuration ;-(
* it seems that there is a bug on speed it is played (if i play
   replays done on fast machine, it appear faster)
* pb for left hand written people for the editor
* two possibilities to show room : one to see the world highscore, one
   to see you room (optionnal)
* allow to run : xmoto -level l1.lvl to allow playing a level just by cliking on
   it (even if it's not in the xmoto dir)
* display wind
* high level function for script : DynamicMove(item, srcX, srcY, dstX, dstY,
   speed, type = "linear") for example : one call manage the movement of the element

Fixed:

* BUG : bug in the editor if you load and save http://xmoto.free.fr/levels/l189.lvl because  > is replaced by &gt;      
* Make sure LUA5.1 is supported properly OR use LUA5.0 explicitly. -> see http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#incompat
* BUG : xmoto crashes when some textures are missing for a level
* display time diff for the ghost nicer
* make a vector for replays to load them faster
* BUG : xmoto-edit downloaded/l66.lvl then "play this level" -> "Cave
   : level not found" because there is a space in the id
* BUG : if www is not activated at startup, go in option, check www, then click on proxy, then ok => www is unchecked
* BUG : update highscore button, check for new levels too
* BUG : when you have a level to update, you update it ; it you
   reclick on check for new level, it will reupdate it, and you can
   continue ... it adds the levels several times in the list
* BUG : notifyMsg(GAMETEXT_FAILEDDLHIGHSCORES); does not work the first time we load the game called in gamemenu.cpp, line 1573 but not displayed, i don't know why
* BUG : when you update levels, new levels is displayed again !
* use bSomething for options instead of many calls
* add an option for timediff with the ghost
* BUG : if you die and save the replay, replay list is empty ; if you
   delete one, it does not delete it
* add highscore tab in pack and new levels (priority=high)
