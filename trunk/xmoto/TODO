* BUG on makefile
I got a bug in the gentoo bugzilla:
http://bugs.gentoo.org/147725 xmoto-0.2.1 fails with MAKEOPTS="-j2" or higher.
You moved the xmoto target to the subdir but still wants the result in the
top directory. But the rule here is broken
xmoto: src/xmoto
      ln -sf src/xmoto xmoto
make -j2 xmoto produces
make: *** No rule to make target `src/xmoto'.  Stop.
yet cd src; make xmoto works. Can you please have a look at it and
revert the change if no better solution is found?

* bug on rewind on http://xmoto.free.fr/replays/replay_5297.rpl

* <aspegic500> xmoto 0.2.1 ?
[11:25] <Fifty> yep, that's the version
[11:26] <aspegic500> sudo dpkg -l | grep libode : have you other version of ode installed ?
[11:27] <Fifty> libode0-dev and libode0c2
[11:27] <Fifty> both 0.5-5
[11:28] <aspegic500> /tmp/ccsG3NjU.o: In function `main':/home/nicolas/xmoto_dev/xmoto/conftest.cc:45: undefined reference to `dJointAttach'
[11:28] <aspegic500> collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
[11:28] <aspegic500> i get this
[11:28] <aspegic500> but it configure works... ?!? strange
[11:28] <Fifty> yeah :/
[11:28] <aspegic500> what are the last lines of your config.log ?
[11:29] <Fifty> #define STDC_HEADERS 1
[11:29] <Fifty> #define VERSION "0.2.1"
[11:29] <Fifty> #define XMOTO_LITTLE_ENDIAN 1
[11:29] <Fifty> #endif
[11:29] <Fifty> #ifdef __cplusplus
[11:29] <Fifty> void exit (int);
[11:29] <Fifty> configure: exit 1
[11:32] [DCC] Proposition d'envoi de « configure » à Fifty...
[11:32] <aspegic500> have a try with this configure,
[11:32] <aspegic500> i removed the check on libode
[11:32] <Fifty> ok
[11:32] [DCC] Envoi DCC du fichier « /home/nicolas/xmoto_dev/xmoto/configure » terminé.
[11:33] <aspegic500> but i think there is really a pb
[11:38] <Fifty> I'll try compiling it
[11:39] <Fifty> hmm, it exited with this:
[11:39] <Fifty> ../depcomp: line 512: exec: g++: not found
[11:39] <Fifty> make[1]: *** [BuiltInFont.o] Error 127
[11:39] <Fifty> make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/brodie/Desktop/0._Inbox/xmoto-0.2.1/src'
[11:39] <Fifty> make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
[11:41] <aspegic500> have you g++ installed ?
[11:41] <Fifty> not yet. I'm downloading it now
[11:41] <aspegic500> then i understand the pb
[11:42] <aspegic500> the configure don't check that g++ is installed
[11:42] <aspegic500> but to check libode,
[11:42] <Fifty> ah :)
[11:42] <aspegic500> it tries to use stdc++

* bzip2 not removed on windows : to test

* Bug,
scenario:
- you touch the flower, but the is still a strawberry to take
  => m_bFinished remains to false
- you touch the last strawberry, but you are always touching the flower
 => this event is not called, m_bFinished remains to false
- you go out of the flower
 => nothing it called, m_bFinished remains to false
http://xmoto.free.fr/interesting_replays/ireplay_40.rpl

    case ET_ENDOFLEVEL:
      {
	      /* How many strawberries left? */
	      if(countEntitiesByType(ET_STRAWBERRY) == 0) {
	        /* Level is done! */
	        m_bFinished = true;
	        m_fFinishTime = getTime();
	      }
      }
* BUG: Replays break on Linux/PPC. Screenshot: http://vasi.webhop.org/files/ports/xmoto/xmoto-bug.jpg
	* Probably fixed, waiting for verification by Marcel

### not important, not really necesary, very low urgency, or just makes thing more complex:

* BUG : http://forum.xmoto.free.fr/viewtopic.php?p=205#205 (no clue how to fix)
* BUG ? http://forum.xmoto.free.fr/viewtopic.php?p=212#212 (not really i bug methinks)
* remove the "level packs" button, remove the "internal" and "external" tabs and replace them by "All levels" tab and "Level pack" tab and make internal level a pack
* change theme without restart
* SDL_ttf or something like that for rendering text
*(20:39:54) Neckelmann:   the game should really do all this:
zone1 = {}
zone1a = {}
zone1b = {}
zone2 = {}
zone2a = {}
zone2b = {}
* script :
   add : rotation for blocks         
* Add a command line option like the one to test themes. This option could be ''testscript'' and would show zones during game (with an extra, the name of the zone).
* BUG : save a replay as 0.0.0.0 restart xmoto, it doesn't appear in
   the list
* to be able to give a color to a block as parameter in a level
   (instead of a texture)
* if some texture are missing, but backgound in black and foreground in white so that the level can be playable
* change ghost rules : "player/players/room"
* bug : keys 1 2 3 4 5 won't work on french keybord : allow to configure key action for script instead of allow the script to choose the key
* OS X stuff:
        * Add Universal Binary build system to subdirectory.
        * Modify so it could run on a compile farm.
        * Use Application Support directory instead of ~/.xmoto on OS X
        * Better packaging for OS X (Readme, License, etc)
* BUG: tu peux faire get more levels une fois par session ? really ?!? to try
* BUG : as you can see at the end of "the only smooth", the block is
   not correctly drawned
* BUG : is it normal ?
        C.x=(getParent()->getDispWidth() * pArrow->ArrowPointerPos.x) / 800.0f;
        C.y=(getParent()->getDispHeight() * pArrow->ArrowPointerPos.y)
   / 600.0f;
        moreover, it doesn't work with the zoom
   and Game.PlaceScreenArrow(5, 5, 225) : doesn't respect coords
  nicolas: in fact, arrows of script are dependant of the resolution ;
   so i did not documented them while it's not clean :
       The concerned functions are :
       PlaceInGameArrow(x, y, angle)
       Place an arrow in the game to show something to the player
       PlaceScreenArrow(x, y, angle)
       Place an arrow in the game to show something to the player.
       Position is relative to the screen
       HideArrow()
       Hide the arrow
* it seems that there is a bug on speed it is played (if i play
   replays done on fast machine, it appear faster) http://xmoto.free.fr/replays/replay_1312.rpl
* BUG :
- start a level, press very fastly (ESC-ENTER)* ; quite easy to
   reproduce (works on windows and linux)
   try {
     m_Renderer.render();
   } in Game.cpp to catch the exception.
   in VApp.cpp, if you replace while(SDL_PollEvent(&Event)) by
   if(SDL_PollEvent(&Event)), the pb disappear.
   event order threaten is ENTER then ESC
   _RestartLevels is called
   then the ESC is managed and it fails
* see about timeout when connection failed
 comment : it seems that there is nothing to do unless reduce
   connection timeout (or multithreading)

* "view the highscore" button is not visible for pack
* when you press o in the level list and that no level start with an
   o, it bases on the 2nd letter,...
* themes : check the md5sum of the files ; don't display available if
   it's not really available
* "play next level" => 'play next level', 'play next level unplayed', 'play next level where your highscore is > than room highscore', 'play next level where your highscore is > than world highscore', 'play next level where your highscore is the best'
* replay button when you finish a level (to replay the level just done)

* xmoto -nosound
* use z-buffer for depth ordering
* BUG : when you see level info in level pack ; then you click on ok
   -> it close the window and the levelpack window
* loadness of headcrash sound should depend on head velocity 
* feature : a replay button when you finish a level (or die) which
   plays Latest.rpl
* themes : not more animation in .xml ? -> be able to load an animated bike ?
* to be able to move a zone ?
* make sound in themes
* we could make a "standard xmoto library" of lua functions :)
* new script call :
  timePenallity(nbSeconds) -> increase time
  collision between sprites, between sprites and head
* have a <----> for the lists
* if a script ask for an already used key, propose an other one
* a button "clean replays" which remove not highscore replays or
   something like it
* check for a new version at startup
* add a counter of uncompleted levels (priority=medium)
* add a tab : favorite levels (priority=low)
* add 2 rooms configurations so that i can display, world highscore
   and highscore of my room (priority=low)
* add import of players.bin (so that people playing at different
   location can merge their highscores) (priority=very low)
* separate personnal highscores from others (two tabs instead of a
   button, it's easiest) (it neckelmann agree)
* pb for left hand written people for the editor
* two possibilities to show room : one to see the world highscore, one
   to see you room (optionnal)
* allow to run : xmoto -level l1.lvl to allow playing a level just by cliking on
   it (even if it's not in the xmoto dir)
* display wind
* a fonction CameraRotate and CameraAdaptToG (script)
* A SetDynamicBlockRotation function that rotates the vertices about a center point instead of making the block go in circles.
* network game
