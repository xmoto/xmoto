# for 0.2.0

######################################################################
Assigned to Neckelmann:
* "view the highscore" button is not visible for pack(priority=high)
* add <xml_room> in configuration so that the player can choose the
   link to his room xml file (priority=high)(priority=high)
* BUG: the window "it seems you have not OpenGL, please check your configuratino" can't be close by clicking on the ok button.(priority=high)
* BUG : move objects in script doesn't work(priority=medium)
* I thought to one thing that could be add in the stats : the date
   when the stats have been initialized to display : stats from
   18/06/2006 for example. Remember that this field must be translatable

######################################################################
Assigned to Nicolas:
* theme (for sprites) (priority=high)
* high level function for script : DynamicMove
Game.SetDynamicEntityRotation("Strawberry0", 0, 3, 500, 0, 0)
Game.SetDynamicEntityTranslation("Strawberry0", 3, 1, 500, 0, 0)
Game.SetDynamicEntityNone("Strawberry0")
add the same for block once block move will work
* a texture missing -> just give an alert instead of get an exception

######################################################################
Unassigned:

* new script call :
killPlayer() -> kill the player
timePenallity(nbSeconds) -> increase time
zoom
moveCamera
be able to move camera : at least choose 3 positions middle, left or right

* collision : collision with the body : triangle with points : head,
   wheels : because it's currently possible to touch a wecker with the
   body and possible to touch a strawberry but that it doesn't take
   it. However, this collision must be avaible only for entities not
   for blocks.

* GameEventLuaCallSetBlockCenter
  and GameEventLuaCallSetBlockRotation
  missing in serialisation

* BUG : is it normal ?
        C.x=(getParent()->getDispWidth() * pArrow->ArrowPointerPos.x) / 800.0f;
        C.y=(getParent()->getDispHeight() * pArrow->ArrowPointerPos.y)
   / 600.0f;
        moreover, it doesn't work with the zoom
and Game.PlaceScreenArrow(5, 5, 225) : doesn't respect coords
* BUG : OnLoad() { return false; } -> segfault
* BUG : when you see level info in level pack ; then you click on ok
   -> it close the window and the levelpack window
* BUG: When you make a room highscore, SOMETIMES! the message NEW HIGHSCORE keep in place after...
* add 3 2 1 GO ! at level startup (only if the level played is
   different from the last played)
* have a <----> for the lists
* it seems that there is a bug on speed it is played (if i play
   replays done on fast machine, it appear faster) http://xmoto.free.fr/replays/replay_1312.rpl
* BUG :
- start a level, press very fastly (ESC-ENTER)* ; quite easy to
   reproduce (works on windows and linux)
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/nicolas/progs/archives/xmoto_cvs/xmoto/xmoto
Program exited normally.
Game.cpp around 1210 : adding a catch ; however, when the exception is
   catched, the level is displayed badly
   	  try {
   	    m_Renderer.render();
	  } catch(Exception &e) {printf("Exception handled\n");}
UPDATE:  It appears it's only possible to produce the bug when ghost is enabled.

# for later:
* replay arch indepedance structure
* see about timeout when connection failed
* display a nice counter for engine speed : disable this counter in replays
* a button "clean replays" which remove not highscore replays or
   something like it
* check for a new version at startup
* add a counter of uncompleted levels (priority=medium)
* add a tab : favorite levels (priority=low)
* add 2 rooms configurations so that i can display, world highscore
   and highscore of my room (priority=low)
* add import of players.bin (so that people playing at different
   location can merge their highscores) (priority=very low)
* translations (priority=very low)

Undecided:
* allow keep button pressed on list for people having not wheel ;-)
* context information for levels : when one is selected, display
   information
* separate personnal highscores from others (two tabs instead of a
   button, it's easiest) (it neckelmann agree)
* upload highscore from the game ? (require login/password room
   configuration ;-(
* pb for left hand written people for the editor
* two possibilities to show room : one to see the world highscore, one
   to see you room (optionnal)
* allow to run : xmoto -level l1.lvl to allow playing a level just by cliking on
   it (even if it's not in the xmoto dir)
* display wind
