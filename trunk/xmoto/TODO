* Make sure LUA5.1 is supported properly OR use LUA5.0 explicitly.
  -> see http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#incompat
* BUG : if www is not activated at startup, go in option, check www,
   then click on proxy, then ok => www is unchecked

* BUG : notifyMsg(GAMETEXT_FAILEDDLHIGHSCORES); does not work the
   first time we load the game called in gamemenu.cpp, line 1573 but
   not displayed, i don't know why
* BUG : move objects in script doesn't work

* try to compile without WEBSUPPORT and GHOST to see the result
* add highscore tab in pack and new levels (priority=high)
* see :
   http://aspegic500.free.fr/xmoto_highscores/replays/replay_707.rpl :
   it seems that there is a bug on replays (priority=high)
* add <xml_room> in configuration so that the player can choose the
   link to his room xml file (priority=high)
* add a button <see replay> which download the highscore from the
   website and play it (priority=high)
  add informatin about highscore when a level is selected (name of the
   driver, <see button>, ...)  
* add a counter of uncompleted levels (priority=medium)
* theme (for sprites) (priority=medium)
* add a tab : favorite levels (priority=low)
* add 2 rooms configurations so that i can display, world highscore
   and highscore of my room (priority=low)
* add import of players.bin (so that people playing at different
   location can merge their highscores) (priority=very low)
* translations (priority=very low)

Ghost finition :
* make a vector for replays to load them faster

Undecided:
* allow keep button pressed on list for people having not wheel ;-)
* add 3 2 1 GO ! at level startup (it neckelmann agree) 
* context information for levels : when one is selected, display
   information
* separate personnal highscores from others (two tabs instead of a
   button, it's easiest) (it neckelmann agree)
* upload highscore from the game ? (require login/password room
   configuration ;-(
* it seems that there is a bug on speed it is played (if i play
   replays done on fast machine, it appear faster)
* pb for left hand written people for the editor
* two possibilities to show room : one to see the world highscore, one
   to see you room (optionnal)
* allow to run : xmoto -level l1.lvl to allow playing a level just by cliking on
   it (even if it's not in the xmoto dir)
* display wind
* an option to save automatically the replay if it's a highscore
