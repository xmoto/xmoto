PLEASE NOTE:
By the way, I've added a particle effect for when picking up strawberries.
Maybe it's too over the top, I don't know. It's easy to remove again.
Also, I couldn't figure out how to add the graphics... it worked at a time,
but now it doesn't work anymore. I'll try to figure out why.

-- comment: i like it : it works for me : the reason why it didn't
   work at start : the star anim is described into original.xml ; but
   when you update the theme from web, the original theme from the web
   is prefered as your new one (because it includes sprites for prince
   of persia, ...), so to conclude, the version on internet must
   include all the sprites of the original one. To test, first time, i
   just removed the files into my ~/.xmoto/Themes/*.xml. I will
   updated themes from internet.
=> stars are not in replays.

=> i added Textures/Sprites/YellowFlare.png that i found, was i a good
   idea ? because it was in original.xml but not in package.lst

# for 0.2.0
######################################################################
Assigned to Neckelmann:
* is it possible to include the speed of the dynamic blocks with lua ?
   the aim is that normally, the moto must move on a block moving
   horizontally
 --comment: well, generally the script is totally responsible for moving
            the blocks, so the script can calculate the velocity itself.            
 -> it is not it : i mean : when you move a block, and when you bike
   is under it, logically, bike should move too : it's
   physics. Currently, it doesn't work because a move is not really a
   move, it's a teleportation, so there is no velocity.

* the jump of the moto with dynamic blocks is too much (is this jump
   really necessary ?)
 --comment: i'd rather not touch that any more, i think it's quite stable
            as it is. And yes, the jump is necesary, that's how the 
            physics engine works (to seperate intersection objects/bodies
            it tries to "push" them appart)

* BUG : kill bill if you try this level since the last recent change
   about collision (.16), the start of the level is not the same : the
   player does not fall as the same way
 -- comment : just add an information into the changelog

* "view the highscore" button is not visible for pack(priority=high)
* add <xml_room> in configuration so that the player can choose the
   link to his room xml file (priority=high)(priority=high)
* I thought to one thing that could be add in the stats : the date
   when the stats have been initialized to display : stats from
   18/06/2006 for example. Remember that this field must be translatable
* themes : not more animation in .xml ? -> be able to load an animated bike ?
* now that there is a lot of replays (dwd due to ghosts), what about
  put "list all" by default in the replays list ?
* BUG : xmoto-edit rgeznlre -> segfault
* smoke doesn't work in replay, it didn't work in .16
   --comment: particles have never been present in replays. It should
              not be a problem to add them, and it wouldn't add much
              to the file size (no reason why actual particle 
              positions should be the same when replaying)
* BUG : OnLoad() { return false; } -> segfault
* BUG : when you see level info in level pack ; then you click on ok
   -> it close the window and the levelpack window

* BUG : see http://xmoto.free.fr/images/administration/download.png :
   when you press z or other keys allowed by this level while you bike
   is not moving at all

# for after
* make something when a perious jump is done : it is quite easy i
   think to detect them
* to be able to move a zone ?
* make sound in themes
* make circle for sprites, strawberries, ... in ugly mode
* BUG : http://xmoto.free.fr/tmp/bugonlinuxppcreplays.jpg : it
   happends on replays on linux ppc
*OpenGL-independent Renderer
   I would like to port XMoto to my GP2X, a Linux-based
 handheld game console. The main problem is that due to
 the lack of an FPU, no OpenGL-implementations with
 acceptable performance are available. The
 floating-point emulation works quite good, so im sure
 that Physics still could be done with ODE.
 But the graphics part would have to be done with the
 2D-capabilities of SDL. I could write a new Renderer
 myself, but i would have to fork the code at its
 current state because OpenGL is tied too deep with the
 code.
 The renderer should be abstracted, so a SDL-Renderer
 can be easily integrated. I think a 2D-based renderer
 would also enable older platforms to play XMoto.
* svg2xmotolvl
* otherwise we could make a "standard xmoto library" of lua functions :)
function testCollision(laserX, laserY, alienX, alienY)
    -- to be remplaced by a real circle collision
    -- made by xmoto using entity r
    alienHalfWidth  = 0.5
    alienHalfHeight = 0.5
    laserHalfWidth  = 0.4
    laserHalfHeight = 0.4

    return laserX + laserHalfWidth &gt; alienX - alienHalfWidth
          and laserX - laserHalfWidth  &lt; alienX + alienHalfWidth
          and laserY + laserHalfHeight &gt; alienY - alienHalfHeight
          and laserY - laserHalfHeight &lt; alienY + alienHalfHeight
end
* loading level is sometimes quite long
* new script call :
  killPlayer() -> kill the player
  timePenallity(nbSeconds) -> increase time
* collision : collision with the body : triangle with points : head,
   wheels : because it's currently possible to touch a wecker with the
   body and possible to touch a strawberry but that it doesn't take
   it. However, this collision must be avaible only for entities not
   for blocks.
* BUG : is it normal ?
        C.x=(getParent()->getDispWidth() * pArrow->ArrowPointerPos.x) / 800.0f;
        C.y=(getParent()->getDispHeight() * pArrow->ArrowPointerPos.y)
   / 600.0f;
        moreover, it doesn't work with the zoom
and Game.PlaceScreenArrow(5, 5, 225) : doesn't respect coords
* add 3 2 1 GO ! at level startup (only if the level played is
   different from the last played)
* have a <----> for the lists
* it seems that there is a bug on speed it is played (if i play
   replays done on fast machine, it appear faster) http://xmoto.free.fr/replays/replay_1312.rpl
* BUG :
- start a level, press very fastly (ESC-ENTER)* ; quite easy to
   reproduce (works on windows and linux)
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/nicolas/progs/archives/xmoto_cvs/xmoto/xmoto
Program exited normally.
Game.cpp around 1210 : adding a catch ; however, when the exception is
   catched, the level is displayed badly
   	  try {
   	    m_Renderer.render();
	  } catch(Exception &e) {printf("Exception handled\n");}
UPDATE:  It appears it's only possible to produce the bug when ghost is enabled.

* if a script ask for an already used key, propose an other one
* replay arch indepedance structure
* see about timeout when connection failed
* display a nice counter for engine speed : disable this counter in replays
* a button "clean replays" which remove not highscore replays or
   something like it
* check for a new version at startup
* add a counter of uncompleted levels (priority=medium)
* add a tab : favorite levels (priority=low)
* add 2 rooms configurations so that i can display, world highscore
   and highscore of my room (priority=low)
* add import of players.bin (so that people playing at different
   location can merge their highscores) (priority=very low)
* translations (priority=very low)

Undecided:
* allow keep button pressed on list for people having not wheel ;-)
* context information for levels : when one is selected, display
   information
* separate personnal highscores from others (two tabs instead of a
   button, it's easiest) (it neckelmann agree)
* upload highscore from the game ? (require login/password room
   configuration ;-(
* pb for left hand written people for the editor
* two possibilities to show room : one to see the world highscore, one
   to see you room (optionnal)
* allow to run : xmoto -level l1.lvl to allow playing a level just by cliking on
   it (even if it's not in the xmoto dir)
* display wind
