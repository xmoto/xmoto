* add highscore tab in pack and new levels (priority=high)
* see :
   http://aspegic500.free.fr/xmoto_highscores/replays/replay_707.rpl :
   it seems that there is a bug on replays (priority=high)
* add <xml_room> in configuration so that the player can choose the
   link to his room xml file (priority=high)
* add a button <see replay> which download the highscore from the
   website and play it (priority=high)
* what about check for new levels at startup and propose to download
   new levels ? (with a small non-intrusive message) (priority=high)
* add a counter of uncompleted levels (priority=medium)
* theme (for sprites) (priority=medium)
* add a tab : favorite levels (priority=low)
* add 2 rooms configurations so that i can display, world highscore
   and highscore of my room (priority=low)
* add import of players.bin (so that people playing at different
   location can merge their highscores) (priority=very low)
* translations (priority=very low)
* correct Resolution for 16bpp and 32bpp

Ghost finition :
* do not reload the ghost if it is already the good loaded
* make a vector for replays to load them faster
* strategy : get the best of the room and reload it if required
* add an option for blur in interface

Undecided:
* add 3 2 1 GO ! at level startup (it neckelmann agree) 
* context information for levels : when one is selected, display
   information
* separate personnal highscores from others (two tabs instead of a
   button, it's easiest) (it neckelmann agree)
* upload highscore from the game ? (require login/password room
   configuration ;-(
* it seems that there is a bug on speed it is played (if i play
   replays done on fast machine, it appear faster)
* pb for left hand written people for the editor
* two possibilities to show room : one to see the world highscore, one
   to see you room (optionnal)
* allow to run : xmoto l1.lvl or xmoto r1.rpl depending on the
   extension to allow playing a level or a replay just by cliking on
   it (and why not even if it's not in the xmoto dir)
* save scripted replays
