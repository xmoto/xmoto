### For 0.2.1

* remove the "level packs" button, remove the "internal" and "external" tabs and replace them by "All levels" tab and "Level pack" tab and make internal level a pack
* BUG: tu peux faire get more levels une fois par session
* xmoto-edit fezfezfezf : segfault : again 
* level no doubt : start ; pause 30 sec ; run very fast ->
   http://testnitrx.free.fr/xmoto/screenshot0006.png : a block appears !
* for the automatic upload, add :
   check why i can't have a & in my password
* BUG : as you can see at the end of "the only smooth", the block is
   not correctly drawned
* bug on review a replay : when you forward to fast, the man does not
   go at the end of the level
* BUG : is it normal ?
        C.x=(getParent()->getDispWidth() * pArrow->ArrowPointerPos.x) / 800.0f;
        C.y=(getParent()->getDispHeight() * pArrow->ArrowPointerPos.y)
   / 600.0f;
        moreover, it doesn't work with the zoom
   and Game.PlaceScreenArrow(5, 5, 225) : doesn't respect coords
  nicolas: in fact, arrows of script are dependant of the resolution ;
   so i did not documented them while it's not clean :
       The concerned functions are :
       PlaceInGameArrow(x, y, angle)
       Place an arrow in the game to show something to the player
       PlaceScreenArrow(x, y, angle)
       Place an arrow in the game to show something to the player.
       Position is relative to the screen
       HideArrow()
       Hide the arrow
* it seems that there is a bug on speed it is played (if i play
   replays done on fast machine, it appear faster) http://xmoto.free.fr/replays/replay_1312.rpl
* BUG :
- start a level, press very fastly (ESC-ENTER)* ; quite easy to
   reproduce (works on windows and linux)
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/nicolas/progs/archives/xmoto_cvs/xmoto/xmoto
Program exited normally.
Game.cpp around 1210 : adding a catch ; however, when the exception is
   catched, the level is displayed badly
   	  try {
   	    m_Renderer.render();
	  } catch(Exception &e) {printf("Exception handled\n");}
UPDATE:  It appears it's only possible to produce the bug when ghost is enabled.
* see about timeout when connection failed
 comment : it seems that there is nothing to do unless reduce
   connection timeout (or multithreading)

# feature which are not really bugs for 0.2.1
* "view the highscore" button is not visible for pack
* make circle for sprites, strawberries, ... in ugly mode
* when you press o in the level list and that no level start with an
   o, it bases on the 2nd letter,...
* loading level is sometimes quite long
  nicolas : in fact, when you just want to see a replay (xmoto -replay
   ...) ; it's long just for it.
* themes : check the md5sum of the files ; don't display available if
   it's not really available
* "play next level" => 'play next level', 'play next level unplayed', 'play next level where your highscore is > than room highscore', 'play next level where your highscore is > than world highscore', 'play next level where your highscore is the best'

### for 0.3.0 and after
* xmoto -nosound
* use z-buffer for depth ordering
* BUG : when you see level info in level pack ; then you click on ok
   -> it close the window and the levelpack window
* loadness of headcrash sound should depend on head velocity 
* feature : a replay button when you finish a level (or die) which
   plays Latest.rpl
* a lua function to get the number of
   somersaults ? some "freestyle" could ask for figure to be done.
   in the future, i would like make this functionnality better : time
   in the air, time on one wheel, ...
* add <xml_room> in configuration so that the player can choose the
   link to his room xml file (priority=high)(priority=high)
* themes : not more animation in .xml ? -> be able to load an animated bike ?
* to be able to move a zone ?
* make sound in themes
* we could make a "standard xmoto library" of lua functions :)
* new script call :
  killPlayer() -> kill the player
  timePenallity(nbSeconds) -> increase time
  collision between sprites, between sprites and head
  move a zone
* collision : collision with the body : triangle with points : head,
   wheels : because it's currently possible to touch a wecker with the
   body and possible to touch a strawberry but that it doesn't take
   it. However, this collision must be avaible only for entities not
   for blocks.
* add 3 2 1 GO ! at level startup (only if the level played is
   different from the last played)
* have a <----> for the lists
* if a script ask for an already used key, propose an other one
* display a nice counter for engine speed : disable this counter in replays
* a button "clean replays" which remove not highscore replays or
   something like it
* check for a new version at startup
* add a counter of uncompleted levels (priority=medium)
* add a tab : favorite levels (priority=low)
* add 2 rooms configurations so that i can display, world highscore
   and highscore of my room (priority=low)
* add import of players.bin (so that people playing at different
   location can merge their highscores) (priority=very low)
* translations (priority=very low)
* separate personnal highscores from others (two tabs instead of a
   button, it's easiest) (it neckelmann agree)
* upload highscore from the game ? (require login/password room
   configuration ;-(
* pb for left hand written people for the editor
* two possibilities to show room : one to see the world highscore, one
   to see you room (optionnal)
* allow to run : xmoto -level l1.lvl to allow playing a level just by cliking on
   it (even if it's not in the xmoto dir)
* display wind
* a fonction CameraRotate and CameraAdaptToG (script)
