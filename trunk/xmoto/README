X-Moto 0.1.7 (Alpha Release)
Copyright (C) 2005 Rasmus Neckelmann (neckelmann@gmail.com)

NOTES ABOUT 0.1.7: 
 * The sound system is not good. I'll change to SDL_mixer in one of the 
   next releases.
 * Due to the change of level numbering for this release, your previous
   high scores will probably be invalid. If that is a problem to you,
   please make a backup copy of your players.bin file. 
   Under all circumstances you should delete your old players.bin file
   when upgrading to 0.1.7.

IMPORTANT: This is an ALPHA release of the game, which means that many
things aren't production stable. Also note that the final release of
the game will include many more levels.
 
I'll strongly appreciate any bug reports, feature requests, general 
bashing, etc. Please help making the game better.

Introduction
============

X-Moto is a challenging 2D motocross platform game, where physics play 
an all important role in the gameplay. You need to control your bike to 
its limit, if you want to have a chance finishing the more difficult of 
the challenges. 

First you'll try just to complete the levels, while later you'll compete 
with yourself and others, racing against the clock.  

Installation
============

The file INSTALL offers information on how to get X-Moto up and 
running on your non-Windows computer. If you're reading this file on
you're Windows computer, you've probably already installed X-Moto
successfully :)

Basic Gameplay
==============

A number of strawberries are spread around each level, which generally 
consists of a complicated landscape seen from the side - i.e. much like 
islands in the sky. You need to collect all these berries to 
complete the level - when you've got the last one, you should find 
the sunflower which will complete the level when you touch it. 
Variations to this basic gameplay may be found around some of the 
levels.
Your motocross bike is likewise seen from the side, 
and you control its throttle, braking, and simple changes to the 
attitude by jerking the bike back and forth. Additionally you can change 
the direction of your driving, by rotating on the spot. 

Controls
========

You control your bike using the keyboard:

Up arrow - Accelerates
Down arrow - Brakes
Left arrow - Rotates it counter-clockwise
Right arrow - Rotates it clockwise
Space - Turns around and drives in the other direction

Note that the above keys can be configured to something else to suit
your needs.
Additionally, some other keys can be pressed while playing:

Escape - Pauses the game, and opens the in-game menu
F12 - Takes a screenshot and places it in the game directory
