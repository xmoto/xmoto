Since 1.16
* BUG :Â view highscore with up and down with keyboard does not update the button
* having the information of time diff about the ghost each time you take a strawberry, because we know the information already at this time

Before Xmoto 1.16
* BUG : bug in the editor if you load and save http://xmoto.free.fr/levels/l189.lvl because  > is replaced by &gt;      
* Make sure LUA5.1 is supported properly OR use LUA5.0 explicitly. -> see http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#incompat
* BUG : xmoto crashes when some textures are missing for a level
* display time diff for the ghost nicer
* make a vector for replays to load them faster
* BUG : xmoto-edit downloaded/l66.lvl then "play this level" -> "Cave
   : level not found" because there is a space in the id
* BUG : if www is not activated at startup, go in option, check www, then click on proxy, then ok => www is unchecked
* BUG : update highscore button, check for new levels too
* BUG : when you have a level to update, you update it ; it you
   reclick on check for new level, it will reupdate it, and you can
   continue ... it adds the levels several times in the list
* BUG : notifyMsg(GAMETEXT_FAILEDDLHIGHSCORES); does not work the first time we load the game called in gamemenu.cpp, line 1573 but not displayed, i don't know why
* BUG : when you update levels, new levels is displayed again !
* use bSomething for options instead of many calls
* add an option for timediff with the ghost
* BUG : if you die and save the replay, replay list is empty ; if you
   delete one, it does not delete it
* add highscore tab in pack and new levels
* be able to choose "download highscore" "check for new level" at
   startup
* BUG : xmoto --help causes a crash (trying to free non-init data i think, related to FBO stuff)
* BUG : on mac os x : http://xmoto.free.fr/tmp/Letters.png
* update highscores/levels doesn't really update levels, an other idea
   for the button caption ?
* display error : missing texture instead of just "the level has a pb" ?
* LevelpackList does not allow to see #tutorial 3
* add "required-xmoto-version" field to levels
* make error nicer when impossible to load the script
* add string and table lua classes
* bug on new highscore when the two number a proach
