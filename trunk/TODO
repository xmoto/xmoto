[20:53] <Christoph> can someone watch the world record replay of "MASTERKUD Padrinos magicos"? it aborts with the error "Entity 'MySprite18' doesn't exist" at position 52:47 (with xmoto-0.2.6)


******************
* PERFORMANCE : rebuildLevelsPacks is very slow particularly on windows with a lot of levels : sqlite

* BUG

* pack : last highscores
* pack : last levels

* flag sprite to add
* two options for music : menu and ingame
* hierarchical sort for pack list : +/- to close

* BUG rotation on grass of dynamic blocks on sdlgfx

Assigned to nicolas
* BUG : i ghost is enable, then you disable it, then you play a level
   having a ghost -> cannot found entity
* BUG : hum, about checksum, when you modify a level with f5 while
   playing, then it is not updated with the new level button
* put under edge into the block part
* PAD_5 -> to finish
* BUG : xmoto -replay bugs/onMacWontWork.rpl when you press forward on
   this scripted level, the elevator at the correct position
* FEATURE : * xmoto toto.lvl to play directly a level
* it seems that there is a bug on speed it is played (if i play replays done on fast machine, it appear faster) http://xmoto.free.fr/replays/replay_1312.rpl
* feature : a replay button when you finish a level (or die) which plays Latest.rpl

* when are texure is rotated we need to copy the texture mutplile times so it's always visible
* F5 while developping a level, if the level is scripted, it could
   crash it and required a full F5 at the menu stage

========

* script : disable a key (brake for example, ...)
* ugly uses misc.png for border : should not


====Competitions
* dayly/weekly/monthly competition based on a few tracs , different entry levels easy medium hard
* reset the scores once in a while
* work on not having to validate the scores by hand

===SDL_GFX
* SDL_GFX crashed on mac http://rafb.net/p/L95KzR62.html
* keesj:real caching strategy, currently the SDL_gfx chooses to caches based on expected size of the image
  We need to implement a real caching strategy, for example a LRU hash table (least recently used hashtable
  Here is an article that might be of good use http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article2240.asp)
  I would also like to define the max amound of memory that may be used by the system. if this limit is reachted
  leat recently used images must be throws away
* keesj:SDL_gfx? cache static bloks of the minimap as image
* keesj:create a on screen input system for text
* keesj:create sensititive area's on the screen for gameplay
   -on the nokia 770 it is pretty easy to 
* keesj:test the SDL_gfx version on windows/mac
* keesj:faster startup , smart caching etc system must run under 64 MB :)
* keesj:define code conventions,testing procedures,release-roadbook


* FEATURE : windows : there's some win32 API calls that can be made to determine the application data dir

* when you choose keys : if a key is already attributed, it should
   assign it and set <unset> to the other one because it's not
   pleasant to have a message
* '50 most played levels'/least : virtual package
* a keyboard key for next level
* reload theme done, require tests, and some sprites (like mouse, main menu background) are not updated i suppose
* Sometimes when the edges of the levels are reached (for instance when being at a corner of a level), the
  framerate drops A LOT (game gets unplayable). Can't figure out why.
  ** Update: it actually appears that the game gets slower and slower while running.
* Optimize minimap rendering. On some levels (very smooth ones for instance) it takes much longer to
  render the minimap than the actual level.
* Sometimes memory are leaked from the event queue in m_MotoGame

render entity by Z
render blocks by Z

[13:25] <gaivota> aspegic500: I found a bug which is the following: when letting xmoto running without doing anything for some time the game crashes, althoug it keeps running
[13:26] <gaivota> atm it shows a blank black screen, once before it diplayed the menu althoug the ingame was running and similar strange behaviour

* associate F8 to the -nowww switch (enable/disable network)
 - when a connection fails, disable network and display a message :
   "Network disabled, press F8 to enable it"

* http://bugs.debian.org/335514
It's a bit confusing to be proposed to continue or abort playing when
one has just finished the level. The ``abort'' one should be rather
``quit level'' or something like that.

===========
* BUG : is it normal ?
        C.x=(getParent()->getDispWidth() * pArrow->ArrowPointerPos.x) / 800.0f;
        C.y=(getParent()->getDispHeight() * pArrow->ArrowPointerPos.y)
   / 600.0f;
        moreover, it doesn't work with the zoom
   and Game.PlaceScreenArrow(5, 5, 225) : doesn't respect coords
  nicolas: in fact, arrows of script are dependant of the resolution ;
   so i did not documented them while it's not clean :
       The concerned functions are :
       PlaceInGameArrow(x, y, angle)
       Place an arrow in the game to show something to the player
       PlaceScreenArrow(x, y, angle)
       Place an arrow in the game to show something to the player.
       Position is relative to the screen
       HideArrow()
       Hide the arrow

#############################################################################################
### not important, not really necesary, very low urgency, or just makes thing more complex:

* BUG ? http://forum.xmoto.free.fr/viewtopic.php?p=212#212 (not really i bug methinks)
* SDL_ttf or something like that for rendering text
* script :
   add : rotation for blocks         
* Add a command line option like the one to test themes. This option could be ''testscript'' and would show zones during game (with an extra, the name of the zone).
* BUG : save a replay as 0.0.0.0 restart xmoto, it doesn't appear in
   the list
* to be able to give a color to a block as parameter in a level
   (instead of a texture)
* bug : keys 1 2 3 4 5 won't work on french keybord : allow to configure key action for script instead of allow the script to choose the key
* OS X stuff:
        * Add Universal Binary build system to subdirectory.
        * Modify so it could run on a compile farm.
        * Use Application Support directory instead of ~/.xmoto on OS X
        * Better packaging for OS X (Readme, License, etc)
* BUG : as you can see at the end of "the only smooth", the block is
   not correctly drawned
* BUG :
- start a level, press very fastly (ESC-ENTER)* ; quite easy to
   reproduce (works on windows and linux)
   try {
     m_Renderer.render();
   } in Game.cpp to catch the exception.
   in VApp.cpp, if you replace while(SDL_PollEvent(&Event)) by
   if(SDL_PollEvent(&Event)), the pb disappear.
   event order threaten is ENTER then ESC
   _RestartLevels is called
   then the ESC is managed and it fails
* when you press o in the level list and that no level start with an
   o, it bases on the 2nd letter,...
* themes : check the md5sum of the files ; don't display available if
   it's not really available
* xmoto -nosound
* use z-buffer for depth ordering
* BUG : when you see level info in level pack ; then you click on ok
   -> it close the window and the levelpack window
* loadness of headcrash sound should depend on head velocity 
* themes : not more animation in .xml ? -> be able to load an animated bike ?
* to be able to move a zone ?
* we could make a "standard xmoto library" of lua functions :)
* new script call :
  collision between sprites, between sprites and head
* if a script ask for an already used key, propose an other one
* a button "clean replays" which remove not highscore replays or
   something like it
* check for a new version at startup
* add 2 rooms configurations so that i can display, world highscore
   and highscore of my room (priority=low)
* add import of players.bin (so that people playing at different
   location can merge their highscores) (priority=very low)
* separate personnal highscores from others (two tabs instead of a
   button, it's easiest) (it neckelmann agree)
* pb for left hand written people for the editor
* two possibilities to show room : one to see the world highscore, one
   to see you room (optionnal)
* display wind
* a fonction CameraRotate and CameraRotateAdaptToG (script)
* A SetDynamicBlockRotation function that rotates the vertices about a center point instead of making the block go in circles.
* a block0.Touch() function
* network game
* freestyle mode
