* <music name="None" /> => put levels into musical levels
* mode mirror : the minimap is not mirrored


* [13:49] <gaivota> aspegic500: another bug: although I disabled engine sound in options, it remains in the game

* pour le joystick: le mode mirror ne marche pas

* [21:35] <gaivota> aspegic500: I have a request: It would be nice, that if you zoom in, the camera remains attached to the player, and not to a virtual point
=> dans Renderer.cpp
    float normal_hoffset = 4.0;
    float normal_voffset = 2.0; 
-> cet offset devrait plutot etre celui entre la bordure gauche/droite
   et le joueur

* dans le niveau metallica on voit bien que ca chie certaines textures
   : ca vient du bsp à cause des 4 points rajoutés (boite englobante)
* a force d'ouvrir et de fermer des niveaux, ca bouffe de la mémoire :
   réfléchir à cause du nombre de sprites augmentant à les virer de
   temps en temps

* Theme.cpp : remplacer les anciennes fonts par les nouvelles
* gérer les accents et tous les caractères au clavier (et vérifier que
   ca passe en bd) : see keyboard-0.1.10.patch

*It would be nice if you could use a separate image file for the front
   and the rear wheels of your bike.

[20:26] <Christoph> btw, I noticed a few days ago: in the level "MASTERKUD Padrinos magicos" there is something broken. the strawberry at the right end of the ground crashes the level with "Entity 'MySprite18' doesn't exist" (in the replay, too)

For nicolas
* keyboard for 4 players
* script key on multiplayer : each player must have his own key
* mode 2 joueurs : un message à celui qui gagne
* several joypad (currently, joypack is available only for player 1)
* when you choose keys : if a key is already attributed, it should assign it and set <unset> to the other one because it's not pleasant to have a message
* meme si on ne télécharge pas tous les niveaux, mettre à jour le thème

For Tod:
* load into the graphic card only the blocks which will be displayed depending on the selected graphic quality.
* multicamera
* pas charger les textures en mode ugly (pas celle du background, ...)
* ajouter la tete dans les zones

* zoom in demos :)

* start game with menu music ; go in option; disable sound ; play a
   level ; abort -> the music start because sound is still enabled
* document AddPenaltyTime et empecher de mettre une valeur négative
* il semble qu'une erreur de syntaxe en lua et segfault : ca vient du
   fait que dans drawFrame, dans un case GS_PREPLAY, on peut changer
   d'état (exception) et du coup on tente de dessiner un monde qui
   n'existe plus => séparer le rendu des évènements à suivre
* en mode replay, replay 53361 par exemple, quand on touche la fraise en meme temps que la fleur, la fraise n'eclate pas
* BUG : xmoto -replay bugs/onMacWontWork.rpl when you press forward on
   this scripted level, the elevator at the correct position
* feature : a replay button when you finish a level (or die) which plays Latest.rpl
* script : disable a key (brake for example, ...)

******************
* flag sprite to add
* two options for music : menu and ingame

* BUG rotation on grass of dynamic blocks on sdlgfx

mingw:
* sdlgfx: http://www.wormux.org/wiki/compile_under_mingw.php#SDL_gfx
* gettext: http://www.wormux.org/wiki/compile_under_mingw.php

Assigned to nicolas
* BUG : if ghost is enable, then you disable it, then you play a level
   having a ghost -> cannot found entity
* BUG : hum, about checksum, when you modify a level with f5 while
   playing, then it is not updated with the new level button (if you
   press enter, the level must be dwd)
* put under edge into the block part
* PAD_5 -> to finish

* when are texure is rotated we need to copy the texture mutplile times so it's always visible
* F5 while developping a level, if the level is scripted, it could crash it and required a full F5 at the menu stage

====Competitions
* dayly/weekly/monthly competition based on a few tracs , different entry levels easy medium hard
* reset the scores once in a while
* work on not having to validate the scores by hand

===SDL_GFX
* SDL_GFX crashed on mac http://rafb.net/p/L95KzR62.html
* keesj:real caching strategy, currently the SDL_gfx chooses to caches based on expected size of the image
  We need to implement a real caching strategy, for example a LRU hash table (least recently used hashtable
  Here is an article that might be of good use http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article2240.asp)
  I would also like to define the max amound of memory that may be used by the system. if this limit is reachted
  leat recently used images must be throws away
* keesj:SDL_gfx? cache static bloks of the minimap as image
* keesj:create a on screen input system for text
* keesj:create sensititive area's on the screen for gameplay
   -on the nokia 770 it is pretty easy to 
* keesj:test the SDL_gfx version on windows/mac
* keesj:faster startup , smart caching etc system must run under 64 MB :)
* keesj:define code conventions,testing procedures,release-roadbook
* a keyboard key for next level
* reload theme done, require tests, and some sprites (like mouse, main menu background) are not updated i suppose
* Optimize minimap rendering. On some levels (very smooth ones for instance) it takes much longer to
  render the minimap than the actual level.
* Sometimes memory are leaked from the event queue in m_MotoGame

render entity by Z
render blocks by Z

[13:25] <gaivota> aspegic500: I found a bug which is the following: when letting xmoto running without doing anything for some time the game crashes, althoug it keeps running
[13:26] <gaivota> atm it shows a blank black screen, once before it diplayed the menu althoug the ingame was running and similar strange behaviour

===========
* BUG : is it normal ?
        C.x=(getParent()->getDispWidth() * pArrow->ArrowPointerPos.x) / 800.0f;
        C.y=(getParent()->getDispHeight() * pArrow->ArrowPointerPos.y)
   / 600.0f;
        moreover, it doesn't work with the zoom
   and Game.PlaceScreenArrow(5, 5, 225) : doesn't respect coords
  nicolas: in fact, arrows of script are dependant of the resolution ;
   so i did not documented them while it's not clean :
       The concerned functions are :
       PlaceInGameArrow(x, y, angle)
       Place an arrow in the game to show something to the player
       PlaceScreenArrow(x, y, angle)
       Place an arrow in the game to show something to the player.
       Position is relative to the screen
       HideArrow()
       Hide the arrow

#############################################################################################
### not important, not really necesary, very low urgency, or just makes thing more complex:

* BUG ? http://forum.xmoto.free.fr/viewtopic.php?p=212#212 (not really i bug methinks)
* script :
   add : rotation for blocks         
* BUG : save a replay as 0.0.0.0 restart xmoto, it doesn't appear in
   the list
* to be able to give a color to a block as parameter in a level
   (instead of a texture)
* bug : keys 1 2 3 4 5 won't work on french keybord : allow to configure key action for script instead of allow the script to choose the key
* OS X stuff:
        * Add Universal Binary build system to subdirectory.
        * Modify so it could run on a compile farm.
        * Use Application Support directory instead of ~/.xmoto on OS X
        * Better packaging for OS X (Readme, License, etc)
* BUG : as you can see at the end of "the only smooth", the block is
   not correctly drawned
* BUG :
- start a level, press very fastly (ESC-ENTER)* ; quite easy to
   reproduce (works on windows and linux)
   try {
     m_Renderer.render();
   } in Game.cpp to catch the exception.
   in VApp.cpp, if you replace while(SDL_PollEvent(&Event)) by
   if(SDL_PollEvent(&Event)), the pb disappear.
   event order threaten is ENTER then ESC
   _RestartLevels is called
   then the ESC is managed and it fails
* when you press o in the level list and that no level start with an
   o, it bases on the 2nd letter,...
* themes : check the md5sum of the files ; don't display available if
   it's not really available
* xmoto -nosound
* use z-buffer for depth ordering
* BUG : when you see level info in level pack ; then you click on ok
   -> it close the window and the levelpack window
* loadness of headcrash sound should depend on head velocity 
* themes : not more animation in .xml ? -> be able to load an animated bike ?
* to be able to move a zone ?
* we could make a "standard xmoto library" of lua functions :)
* new script call :
  collision between sprites, between sprites and head
* if a script ask for an already used key, propose an other one
* a button "clean replays" which remove not highscore replays or
   something like it
* check for a new version at startup
* add 2 rooms configurations so that i can display, world highscore
   and highscore of my room (priority=low)
* add import of players.bin (so that people playing at different location can merge their highscores) (priority=very low)
* separate personnal highscores from others (two tabs instead of a
   button, it's easiest)
* two possibilities to show room : one to see the world highscore, one
   to see you room (optionnal)
* display wind
* a block0.Touch() function
* network game
* freestyle mode
