Assigned to manu:
 * allow transparent textures for blocks

Not assigned:
 * <music name="None" /> => put levels into musical levels

 ******************
 * flag sprite to add
 
 ===SDL_GFX
 * when are texure is rotated we need to copy the texture mutplile times so it's always visible
 * sdlgfx with mingw: http://www.wormux.org/wiki/compile_under_mingw.php#SDL_gfx
 * SDL_GFX crashed on mac http://rafb.net/p/L95KzR62.html
 * keesj:real caching strategy, currently the SDL_gfx chooses to caches based on expected size of the image
   We need to implement a real caching strategy, for example a LRU hash table (least recently used hashtable
   Here is an article that might be of good use http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article2240.asp)
   I would also like to define the max amound of memory that may be used by the system. if this limit is reachted
   leat recently used images must be throws away
 * keesj:SDL_gfx? cache static bloks of the minimap as image
 * keesj:create a on screen input system for text
 * keesj:create sensititive area's on the screen for gameplay
    -on the nokia 770 it is pretty easy to 
 * keesj:test the SDL_gfx version on windows/mac
 * keesj:faster startup , smart caching etc system must run under 64 MB :)
 * keesj:define code conventions,testing procedures,release-roadbook
 * a keyboard key for next level
 * reload theme done, require tests, and some sprites (like mouse, main menu background) are not updated i suppose
 * Optimize minimap rendering. On some levels (very smooth ones for instance) it takes much longer to
   render the minimap than the actual level.
 * Sometimes memory are leaked from the event queue in m_MotoGame
 * BUG rotation on grass of dynamic blocks on sdlgfx

### not important, not really necesary, very low urgency, or just makes thing more complex:
 
 * BUG ? http://forum.xmoto.free.fr/viewtopic.php?p=212#212 (not really i bug methinks)
 * OS X stuff:
         * Add Universal Binary build system to subdirectory.
         * Modify so it could run on a compile farm.
         * Use Application Support directory instead of ~/.xmoto on OS X
         * Better packaging for OS X (Readme, License, etc)
 * use z-buffer for depth ordering
 * we could make a "standard xmoto library" of lua functions :)
 * a block0.Touch() function
