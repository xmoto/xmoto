* BUG : kill bill if you try this level since the last recent change
   about collision (.16), the start of the level is not the same : the
   player does not fall as the same way
 -- comment : just add an information into the changelog
* smoke doesn't work in replay, it didn't work in .16
   neckelmann: does it still not work? It appears to work for me
* BUG : see http://xmoto.free.fr/images/administration/download.png :
   when you press z or other keys allowed by this level while you bike
   is not moving at all
  neckelmann: what? it's a picture of a floppy? I don't get it :)
-> http://xmoto.free.fr/interesting_replays/ireplay_41.rpl
  neckelmann: it is because when the bike have been standing (almost) still 
              for a number of frames, physics are disabled. It is to prevent
              the bike from falling into the ground slowly. 
              I've added a function (MotoGame::resetAutoDisabler()) which should
              be called anytime something is changing which might affect the physics
              AND it is absolutely certain that the physics will affect the bike.
              I.e. it should not be called when a block is moved, as it will not always
              affect the bike directly, but on the other hand if the gravity is changed or
              the bike is teleported, it has to be called. 
              Currently it's called by setGravity() and teleport-something().
* I thought to one thing that could be add in the stats : the date
   when the stats have been initialized to display : stats from
   18/06/2006 for example. Remember that this field must be translatable
* stats displayed the month-1 -> i got 2006/06/27 instead of 2006/07/27
* BUG : when you rewind, starts don't move
 neckelmann:  starts? why should they move?
 nicolas: stars
 neckelmann:  hmm, the only way to fix that is to make a "particle rewind"
              function. It's kind of a mess to make, and I don't thinks it's
              that important.

Before Xmoto 1.16
* BUG : bug in the editor if you load and save http://xmoto.free.fr/levels/l189.lvl because  > is replaced by &gt;      
* Make sure LUA5.1 is supported properly OR use LUA5.0 explicitly. -> see http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#incompat
* BUG : xmoto crashes when some textures are missing for a level
* display time diff for the ghost nicer
* make a vector for replays to load them faster
* BUG : xmoto-edit downloaded/l66.lvl then "play this level" -> "Cave
   : level not found" because there is a space in the id
* BUG : if www is not activated at startup, go in option, check www, then click on proxy, then ok => www is unchecked
* BUG : update highscore button, check for new levels too
* BUG : when you have a level to update, you update it ; it you
   reclick on check for new level, it will reupdate it, and you can
   continue ... it adds the levels several times in the list
* BUG : notifyMsg(GAMETEXT_FAILEDDLHIGHSCORES); does not work the first time we load the game called in gamemenu.cpp, line 1573 but not displayed, i don't know why
* BUG : when you update levels, new levels is displayed again !
* use bSomething for options instead of many calls
* add an option for timediff with the ghost
* BUG : if you die and save the replay, replay list is empty ; if you
   delete one, it does not delete it
* add highscore tab in pack and new levels
* be able to choose "download highscore" "check for new level" at
   startup
* BUG : xmoto --help causes a crash (trying to free non-init data i think, related to FBO stuff)
* BUG : on mac os x : http://xmoto.free.fr/tmp/Letters.png
* update highscores/levels doesn't really update levels, an other idea
   for the button caption ?
* display error : missing texture instead of just "the level has a pb" ?
* LevelpackList does not allow to see #tutorial 3
