xmoto (0.2.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

 X-Moto is now hosted on http://tuxfamily.org.

 So that X-Moto can connect to this new server, you have to update the file
 config.dat located at ~/.xmoto/config.dat. You can open this file and replace
 all the occurences of xmoto.free.fr by xmoto.tuxfamily.org or if you don't
 know how to do just replace the file config.dat by the located at

 http://xmoto.tuxfamily.org/dev/config.dat

 (you will lose your configuration, but not your highscores). Moreover, you
 should remove the file rooms.xml next to this one.
